# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Resources

Software: PostgreSQL12 

## Overview of the analysis:

Our company, Pewlitt Hackard, was keen to better understand more about the upcoming retirement wave for its employees.  The company was also keen to develop a mentorship program to potentially retain certain employees eligible for retirement so they can train new hires.  

We were tasked with undertaking additional analysis as follows:

### Deliverable One
1) Create a Retirement Titles table that holds all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955.
2) Create a table that contains the most recent title of each employee. 
3) Create a final table that details the number of retirement-age employees by most recent job title.

### Deliverable Two
1) Create a mentorship-eligibility table that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.

## Results:
